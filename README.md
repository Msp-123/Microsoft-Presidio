**Introduction**

In todayâ€™s world, where data privacy and security are critical, organizations must ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) is protected. Microsoft Presidio is an open-source privacy-preserving text analysis and anonymization tool designed to identify and mask sensitive data, such as names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses.

Presidio is particularly useful in industries like healthcare, finance, and customer support, where handling sensitive data is unavoidable. By automating the detection and anonymization of PII, Presidio helps organizations comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations.


**How Microsoft Presidio Works**

Microsoft Presidio consists of two main components:

  1.Presidio Analyzer: Identifies sensitive information in unstructured text using NLP models.
  
  2.Presidio Anonymizer: Replaces or masks the identified PII with placeholders, ensuring data privacy.


**Key Features:**

  -Prebuilt NLP models for detecting common PII entities like names, locations, phone numbers, and emails.
  
  -Custom recognizers to detect domain-specific sensitive information.
  
  -Supports multiple languages.
  
  -Flexible anonymization techniques, including redaction, replacement, and hashing.



**Detected Entities:**

[type: EMAIL_ADDRESS, start: 118, end: 138, score: 1.0]
[type: PERSON, start: 11, end: 19, score: 0.85]
[type: LOCATION, start: 35, end: 43, score: 0.85]
[type: LOCATION, start: 201, end: 212, score: 0.85]
[type: LOCATION, start: 229, end: 237, score: 0.85]
[type: PHONE_NUMBER, start: 153, end: 165, score: 0.4]


**Anonymized Text:**

My name is <PERSON>, and I live in <LOCATION>. I work at OpenAI as a research scientist.
You can contact me via email at <EMAIL_ADDRESS> or call me at <PHONE_NUMBER>.
I was born on January 15, 1985, in <LOCATION>, but I moved to <LOCATION> in 2010.

**Text with Entity Labels:**

My name is John Doe<PERSON>, and I live in New York<LOCATION>.
